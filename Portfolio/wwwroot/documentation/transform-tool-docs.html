    <h2 id="understanding-transformations">Understanding Transformations</h2>
    <h3 id="perspective-3d-effect">Perspective</h3>
        <p>
          By default, perspective is turned off, ensuring 2D transformations. Enabling it will allow you to move your elements in 3d space.
        </p>
    <h3 id="perspective-impact">Perspective Impact:</h3>
    <p>Enabling the perspective toggle switch influences how other transformations are perceived, adding depth to your design. The css perspective function changes the perceived distance between the back most layer and the viewer. This slider correlates exactly to the css perspective property including the effects it has on the other transform properties.</p>
    <h4 id="nesting-elements">Nesting Elements:</h4>
    <p>The way you structure and nest HTML elements can significantly alter how transformations are applied. For instance when editing a nested object, it takes on the scope of it's outermost parent. This means that if you apply a rotation, the vertex of the rotation point will be based on the outer most html element that your target is nesting in. This can result in a rotation appearing as more of a sweeping motion rather than oriented around a point within the element.</p>
    <h4 id="hierarchy-matters"><strong>Hierarchy Matters</strong>:</h4>
    <p>Elements are transformed based on their position in the HTML hierarchy. A child element's transformation can be influenced by its parent.</p>
